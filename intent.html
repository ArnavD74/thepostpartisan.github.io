		<center><h6><i>by Ahan Raina</i></h6></center>

		<p>I know what you must be thinking. What is the point of another publication claiming they know the truth, the way it all really is? Aren’t there enough blogs, newspapers, magazines, journals, news channels, and YouTube creators who think that they and they alone have the keys to progress and utopia? If we must open our mouth, you may say, why not just post something on our Instagram stories, or write in our town newspaper? Perhaps we are just a bunch of overachievers, hoping to inflate our resumes. Maybe you’re on the left, and you think we’re a discount Prager University, diluted so we don’t get cancelled. Maybe you’re on the right, where you think we are weak-willed centrists afraid to support Trump because of a politically correct society. What use are we, the outcasts? What makes the Postpartsian unique, maybe even necessary?</p>
		<p>It is a paradoxical time to be an American. On one hand, we won the Cold War, have the world’s greatest economy, are a hub of entertainment and the arts, made Enlightenment liberalism the default system for organizing societies globally, and are still a place to which millions of people immigrate in search of a better life. On the other hand, regardless of your political leanings, you may sense that there is a glitch in this matrix. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Political polarization is at record highs, to the point where rather than debating across party lines, each side has created caricatures in their minds of the other side (the whining victim social justice warrior; the white supremacist patriarchal snotty Trump supporter) and choose to bayonet the strawmen. Faith in institutions is crumbling, the average American still struggles economically, our productivity and innovation has flatlined, world affairs feel like a mess, shooters target schoolchildren, and factors out of our control - from race to gender to zipcode - seem to dictate our destiny.</p>
		<p>Let us get something clear from the beginning - these problems are hard, really hard. The mission of alleviating human suffering is next to impossible even when we have ample resources and everyone works on the same team. But we are nowhere near our best. While these problems are multi-faceted and have many causes, we at the Postpartisan believe that there is one plague above all else, a tumor metastasizing in the American and global soul, which most undermines our hopes of solving the great problems -</p>
		<p>Dogma. Ideology.</p>
		<p>Due to its importance to everything written henceforth, it is useful to define exactly what we mean by dogma. To quote the psychologist Jordan Peterson, it is a “crippled religion… religion that is missing an arm and a leg but can still hobble along.” To us, ideology is a set of ideas, principles, or facts which the ideologue, or dogmatist, accepts on faith, often with influence from a higher authority. The dogma claims to be self-contained - all that needs to be known can be derived from within the dogma itself. Because of this omniscience, it can easily be concluded that those within your group can be trusted without question, and that those without are scum who are to be rejected out of hand. An ideology is more interested in its self-preservation and expansion than in the revelation of truth. </p>
		<p>Roman Catholic Christianity, especially in the past, is ideology. The political parties are ideologies. Fundamentalist Islam is an ideology. Communism is an ideology, as is capitalism. Postmodern critical race theory is an ideology. Being a Drake fan is an ideology (while being a Kanye fan isn’t, because we obviously know what the truth is).</p> 
		<p>Now let me clarify two things. First, as with most things in the world, ideology is a continuous variable, not a discrete one. The characteristics I mentioned above are qualities which a group can have more or less of. Even the smallest, most well-intentioned institution will by its very existence exhibit tendencies of self-preservation which may contradict with the truth. And even the most entrenched, tyrannical institution may open its gates to new ideas. </p>
